These are all in the xen-api source tree under the [ocaml/idl](https://github.com/xapi-project/xen-api/tree/a3d339335fd6f4d1f649a40771f0847abdc10e63/ocaml/idl) directory. These are compiled into an executable that's used to generate a large amount of code that actually forms the core of xapi. For example, from these definitions we generate, amongst others, `client.ml` and `server.ml` that contain functions for both ends of the Xen API. The API is quite object oriented, so we declare classes such as `VM` and `host`, and have methods that operate on them, for example, `VM.suspend` or `host.set_name_label`. These classes have fields that are defined by creating values of the [following type](https://github.com/xapi-project/xen-api/blob/a3d339335fd6f4d1f649a40771f0847abdc10e63/ocaml/idl/datamodel_types.ml#L341-L358):\n"},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{},"source":"type field = {\n  release: release;\n  lifecycle: lifecycle_transition list;\n  field_persist: bool;\n  default_value: api_value option;\n  internal_only: bool;\n  qualifier: qualifier;\n  field_name: string;\n  full_name: string list;\n  ty: ty;\n  field_description: string;\n  field_has_effect: bool;\n  field_ignore_foreign_key: bool;\n  field_setter_roles: string list option;\n  field_getter_roles: string list option;\n  field_map_keys_roles: (string * (string list option)) list;\n  field_doc_tags: doc_tag list;\n}","outputs":[],"execution_count":3},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"\nand then these fields are gathered together along with the list of methods into a value that represents the whole class:\n"},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{},"source":"type obj = {\n  name : string;\n  description : string;\n  obj_lifecycle: lifecycle_transition list;\n  contents : content list;\n  messages : message list;\n  doccomments : (string * string) list;\n  msg_lifecycles: ((string * (lifecycle_transition list)) list);\n  gen_constructor_destructor: bool;\n  force_custom_actions: qualifier option; (* None,Some(RW),Some(StaticRO) *)\n  obj_allowed_roles: string list option; (* for construct, destruct and explicit obj msgs*)\n  obj_implicit_msg_allowed_roles: string list option; (* for all other implicit obj msgs*)\n  gen_events: bool;\n  persist: persist_option;\n  obj_release: release;\n  in_database: bool; (* If the object is in the database *)\n  obj_doc_tags: doc_tag list;\n}","outputs":[],"execution_count":4},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"\nWe'll be concentrating on the `contents` field of the object, which contains (slightly indirectly) objects of type `field`.
